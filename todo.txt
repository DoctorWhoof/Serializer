- Wait for Struct constructor reflection bug, update examples when fixed.

- Implement Serializer methods in more class extensions (Material, Texture)

- Maybe wrap generic classes like vectors into serializable classes?


Done!

- Deserializer with extensions (search for Deserialize() method)
	-WIP: Finish CustomDeserializer
	
- Serialize enums
	-Test matLab editor to see if TextureFlags still crashes
	- Deserialize Enums
